## Start the backend server
***Navigate to the root folder***: Navigate to the folder which contains frontend and backend folders, then run the following commands

```bash
cd backend
```

1. **Install Conda**: If you haven't already, install Anaconda.

2. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib pydantic -c conda-forge
```

3. **Train the models and start the backend**

```bash
python main.py
```

## Starting Frontend(in a separate terminal)
1. Start the frontend:
***Navigate to the root folder***: Navigate to the folder which contains frontend and backend folders, then run the following commands

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Monthly Forecasts:
   - Select a month from the navigation
   - View temperature and humidity trends
   - Analyze statistical data

2. Daily Forecasts:
   - Choose a specific date
   - View hourly predictions
   - Interact with charts

3. Data Analysis:
   - Switch between different visualization types
   - Export data in various formats
   - View correlation analysis
